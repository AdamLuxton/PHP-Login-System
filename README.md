# PHP-Login-System
A School Project, coding a custom log-in system in vanilla PHP. I chose to do mine using Bootstrap-Sass.

Project Goals: 
- Welcome screen with date-time specific greetings.
- Account Lockout after a specific number of log-in attempts.
- Forgotten password recovery functionality with email.

Eventually I will also include sign-up functionality as well.
